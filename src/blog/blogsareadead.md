Blogs are dead (kind of like Javascript is dead, because WebAssembly already lets you use real languages, but that won't stop me from following Jeff Atwood's law and *building everything possible in javascript*). Blogs might be mundane and outdated, but they work. A blog might only be seen by 1 or 2 people ever, but those people could matter, a lot.
