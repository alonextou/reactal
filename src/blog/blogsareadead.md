Blogs are dead (kind of like Javascript is dead, because WebAssembly already lets you use real languages, but that won't stop me from following Jeff Atwood's law and *building everything possible in javascript*). Blogs might be mundane and outdated, but they work. A blog might only be seen by 1 or 2 people ever, but those people could matter, a lot.

Most of my important education comes from online articles. Whether an idea, a lesson or both, somebody took extra effort to share something with me, and those people all have something I want in life, experience, or hit points. Some of my most difficult tech problems have been solved thanks to someone else. The oldest programmer I know has written books and has a blog. The most experienced programmer I know has a blog to journal his work. One time, I found the solution to a problem I had configuring NGINX on an old co-workers blog.

With everyone around me having a platform on Youtube, Facebook, or Twitter, this will work if I work it. I'm not limited to 140 characters or media type, I have unlimited creativity. becoming more certain of what I want to do while learning a lot to do it, and not being quite as unseasoned or awestruck as a professional programmer, this becomes a necessary platform.

Also my latest interviewer asked where my blog is...
Seriously, if I'm done being the latest trend knowing, self proclaimed genius, and want to be programming for a long time, I need to do what the long time programmers do. I used to criticize old timers for being irrelevant because tech changes too fast. Now, I need to make sure I become an old timer.




Reinforcing thoughts is important, and sharing them is better.

 and what level I am (life, career, and experience). Some of the highest level people I know have blogs.
